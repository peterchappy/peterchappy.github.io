Hi, I'm Peter Chapman

I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer from Philadelphia. I would consider myself to be a polygot, but my bread and butter is Typescript, React, and Functional Programming. Currently I'm working with the awesome team over at QuotaPath doing just that.

I love being a software engineer. Every day I feel like the kid who grew up wanting to play basketball that actually got drafted into the NBA. I knew that I wanted to be a programmer when at an early age my dad programmed a hack for me to actually beat the original Rouge on our Atari ST.

While you can expect lots of programming talk on this page you'll also find sprinkled in pictures of my cat, recipes I've crafted, reviews of movies and records, progress shots of Gunpla I'm building, and thoughts on the current state of wrestling around the world.

That sounds like a lot, and it is, but as I get older I've found writing to be a good way to solidify and express my viewpoints. A friend of mine use to joke that I'd probably write a memoir one day. While this is not that, it is me planting a flag on a little piece of the internet, and creating passionate content that I enjoy, and hopefully others do too.
